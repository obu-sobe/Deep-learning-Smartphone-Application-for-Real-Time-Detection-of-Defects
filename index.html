  <h1>A Smartphone Application for Real-Time Detection of Defects in Buildings</h1>
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Condition assessment and health monitoring (CAHM) of built assets, requires effective and continuous monitoring of any changes to the material and/or geometric properties of the assets in order to detect any early signs of defects or damage and act on time. Most of the traditional CAHM techniques, however, depend on manual labour despite that, in some cases, the inspection environment can be unsafe and could lead to low efficiency or miss-judgement of the severity of the defect. In recent years, computer vision techniques have been proposed as an automated alternative to the traditional CAHM techniques as methods for extracting and analysing feature-related information from asset images and videos. Such methods have proven to be robust and effective solutions, complementary to current time-consuming and unreliable manual observational practices. </p>
  <p>This work is concerned with the development of a deep learning-based smartphone App which allows real-time detection of four types of defects in buildings namely; cracks, mould, stain, and paint deterioration. Since smartphones are widely available and equipped with high-resolution cameras, this application can offer a practical, low-cost solution for condition assessment procedures of built assets. The obtained results are promising and support the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach to identify and classify various types of building defects.</p>
